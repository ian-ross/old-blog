My name's Ian Ross, and I live in Montpellier in France with my
girlfriend [Rita](http://www.wania.net) and our beagle mix Winnie.
For work, I'm based at [CEFE](http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr), the *Centre
d'Ecologie Fonctionelle et Evolutive*, where I mostly do ecological
modelling of Mediterranean ecosystems.  I've done a lot of other
things in my time ([my CV](/files/cv.pdf)).

Before starting this blog, I had a pile of stuff, mostly travel
photos, on my web site.  All that old stuff is now [here](/old-stuff).
