I'm Ian Ross, I live in [PÃ¶llan][pollan] in Austria with my partner
Rita and our beagle mix Winnie.

I started out as a physicist, but more recently I've been working as a
freelance programmer and data analyst.  I've worked in
programming-centred jobs for about 20 years, in fields as diverse as
climate model development, programming language tools, and sonar
(naval and scientific).  I've also spent a lot of time thinking about
effective scientific data visualisation: there is a portfolio of
selected images [here](/data-visualisation.html).

I now work for [Memcachier](http://www.memcachier.com).

## Things I've been paid money for

#### Using:

Haskell, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, C, C++, R, Java, Fortran (77 &
95), Lisp (Scheme, AUTOLisp, proprietary dialects), APL, SQL,
Mathematica, Matlab, ArcGIS, Perl, NCL, PHP, MPI, Trilinos, SNMP, X,
Motif, Povray, Tcl/Tk

#### to do:

 * [Web apps](/web-apps.html)
 * Climate & vegetation modelling
 * [Data visualisation](/data-visualisation.html)
 * Applied dynamical systems
 * Parallel programming
 * Machine learning & dimensionality reduction
 * Statistical modelling
 * Scientific data analysis
 * Naval sonar performance analysis
 * Scientific sonar data analysis and interfacing
 * Distributed applications & low-level network programming
 * [GUI programming](/gui-programming.html)
 * Programming language tools
 * Atmospheric radiative transfer

## Other things I know about

 * Functional programming (especially Haskell)
 * Other LISPs (Common Lisp, Clojure)
 * Web programming (mostly in Haskell with Yesod; JavaScript)
 * Metalworking & workshop engineering
 * Mechanical design (AutoCAD)
 * Forth, some DSP assembler

## All the grubby details

I have a sort of programming bio [here](/programming-bio.html), and
here's [my CV](/files/cv.pdf).
