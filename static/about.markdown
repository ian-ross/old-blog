My name's Ian Ross, and I live in Igls in Austria with my partner
[Rita](http://www.wania.net) and our beagle mix Winnie.  I work as an
independent software and data analysis contractor (well, that's the
plan: early days yet!).  I've done a lot of other things in my time
([my CV](/files/cv.pdf)).

Before starting this blog, I had a pile of stuff, mostly travel
photos, on my web site.  All that old stuff is now [here](/old-stuff).
