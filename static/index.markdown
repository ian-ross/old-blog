I'm Ian Ross, I live in Igls in Austria with my partner Rita and our
beagle mix Winnie.

I'm a freelance programmer and data analyst who started out as a
physicist.  I've worked in programming-centred jobs for about 20
years, in fields as diverse as climate model development, programming
language tools, and sonar (naval and scientific).  I've also spent a
lot of time thinking about effective scientific data visualisation:
there is a portfolio of selected images
[here](/data-visualisation.html).

I'm available for consulting work in scientific or functional
programming, or data analysis work.  I'm always looking for
interesting projects.  Take a look at my [CV](/files/cv.pdf), take a
look at my [blog](/blog), and
[drop me a line](mailto:ian@skybluetrades.net) to talk about what we
might do.
