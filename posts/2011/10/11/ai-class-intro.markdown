Along with about 160,000 other people, I've signed up for the
[Stanford Introduction to Artificial Intelligence][ai] course.  My
interest in this is two-fold: first for the material, which should be
pretty cool if Peter Norvig's [book][aima] is anything to go by, but
second for just how they (the two instructors plus presumably an army
of TAs) are going to do this.

Perhaps I'm not a very good teacher in a lecture setting, but I have
real trouble connecting even to a class of 90 or so students.  Most
effective *teaching* occurs one-on-one or in small groups in office
hours.  And most *learning* occurs when students are sitting quietly
thinking about things themselves.  How you make contact with and
retain the attention of 85,000 students is a problem that boggles the
mind.  I'm very interested to see how it goes!

The first couple of modules are up on the website already, and it
looks like the format of most of the course will be pretty nice and
accessible.  How assignments and exams will work, we'll have to see.
I really hope Stanford are supplying some additional resources to help
with this project.  It's a very cool thing to be doing, and very
exciting, but it has the potential to be a pretty high stress
adventure for the instructors!

If AI doesn't float your boat, Stanford are also running [Intro to
Machine Learning][ml] and [Intro to Databases][db] courses online as
well.
