"Pour avoir une voiture, sans avoir une voiture"

*To have a car, without having a car*

Car sharing/car club schemes are pretty common in European cities, but
the one here in the south of France is the best I've heard of.  In
Montpellier, it goes by the name of
[Modulauto](http://modulauto.net/).  We pay a (small) monthly fee, can
book cars from a number of parking locations online, pay an
hourly charge and charge per kilometre travelled.  Fuel is included in
the price.  One location is about 5 minutes walk from our house, more
or less all of them are right at tram stops, and the people who
thought this out have done a really good job of locating the cars in
spots where it's easy to navigate to and from (for North American
readers, this is a non-trivial accomplishment in European cities that
grew up during eras when bullock-drawn carts were high technology and
have road plans of a similar vintage).

We have an electronic card to unlock the car (only enabled when you've
booked the car), the keys are inside, there's a Total charge card to
refuel the thing, and a very helpful call centre when things go wrong.
You can book for as short or long a time as you like, and you can
arrange special deals at the office in the centre of town for longer
rentals over quiet periods.  It's generally more economical than
renting a car for periods of less than a few days.

It's actually kind of shocking that it works *so* well.  Going to be a
few minutes late bringing the car back?  Give the office a call, and
they'll make sure you don't pay any late charges (they're helpful!
and efficient! in *France*!).  Had to refuel somewhere other than
Total?  Just drop the receipt into the office and you'll get a refund
on your account in a few days.

More or less every time we use the system, we comment about how good
it is.  I am regularly left reeling by the futuristic efficiency of it
all.  We may not have teleporters and robot servants yet, but we *can*
have cars without having cars!
