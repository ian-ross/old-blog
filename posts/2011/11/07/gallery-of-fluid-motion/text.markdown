Everything's better in slow-motion, right?  And everything's even more
betterer in super-slow-slow-slow slow-mo, am I right?  (You know I'm
right.)  It turns out that if you have a high-speed (10,000 fps!)
camera and a pile of C4 explosive, you can make some pretty cool
movies.  You can read about it [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3090).

On a less explodey note, two other vids from this year's Gallery are
also pretty outstanding:
