title: Oh Canada...
---
I miss Canada.

I miss sea kayaking.

I miss mountain biking.

I miss
[CrossFit Taranis](http://www.crossfitvic.com/CrossFit_Taranis/Home.html)
and all the awesome people there.

We moved to France.  Dumbasses.  We exchanged a fantastic life in
Canada for what?  Basically: cheese.  Feel free to mock us.  We
deserve it.
