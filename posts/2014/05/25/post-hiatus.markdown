It's more than two months since I last wrote a blog article.  I've
been ridiculously busy since then and things are only just now calming
down.  It now looks as though I'm going to try something new, at least
for three months or so, and that should provide more time for
blogging.  I had to drop more or less all of my personal projects for
the last couple of months, which has been frustrating (no work on my
data analysis book, no work on `arb-fft`, very little work on C2HS, a
huge backlog of technical reading piling up and up and up like some
Tower of Techno-Babel).  Things should get back to something more like
normal from now on though.

One benefit of working like a donkey for the last couple of months is
that I now have a bit of money in the bank, and I'm planning to use
that financial window to push some personal projects forwards.  I have
a few ideas, starting with "finishing" `arb-fft` and getting back to
some work on my book.  I'll do a couple of days of paid work a week,
do a bit of open-source stuff (C2HS and Hackage mostly) and work on
those personal projects.  And blogging.  There will be blogging.

Starting tomorrow.  Now though, I'm going to go outside and lie myself
down in the sunshine.
