I haven't done one of these for a *long* time, but I have a big old
pile of interesting things I've read recently.  I might make this a
weekly thing -- [Harry Connolly](http://www.harryjconnolly.com/blog/)
does a Friday Randomness roundup and there's always something
interesting or weird there.  I don't think I can quite attain his
level of randomness, so I'll have to settle for "worth reading" as a
criterion.

1. [Dogs Are People, Too][no1]: Functional MRI for dogs!  And the dogs
   get to choose whether or not to play, which is really great.

2. [The Mother of All Squid Builds a Library][no2]: Lovely short
   story.

3. [What the World Eats][no3]: Twelve families from very different
   parts of the world photographed with a week's worth of groceries.
   I keep going back to look at them.

4. [Meat Atlas][no4]: Friends of the Earth and the Böll Foundation
   produced this report about global meat production, the economics,
   the environmental impacts, and so on.

5. [Hofstadter interview in The Atlantic][no5]: After reading this
   long interview with Douglas Hoftstadter, I was inspired to go back
   and re-read *Gödel, Escher, Bach* and I now have a pile of other
   Hofstadter things to read.  He's a very interesting guy.

6. [The Guardian: Ask a Grown-Up][no6]: This is something The Guardian
   has been doing for a while, but I've only just seen it.  It's a
   great idea.  Children can write in with questions about anything at
   all, and they get answers from experts in whatever field they're
   asking about (or sometimes slightly random celebrities, but mostly
   the answerers know what they're on about).  Best one I've seen so
   far: Douglas Hofstadter (yes, him again!)  answering a
   six-year-old's question "Does my cat Oscar know he's a cat?"!

7. [The UK National Archives][no7]: I've not had much of a chance to
   rummage around in here yet, but it looks like an amazing resource
   where I could probably waste infinite amounts of time.

8. [How Doctors Die][no8]: End-of-life care choices and the
   differences between what doctors recommend to their patients and
   what they do themselves.  Pretty grim, but needs to be talked
   about.

9. [Early Onset Dementia][no9]: More grimness, also needing to be
   talked about.  Early onset dementia (not just Alzheimer's -- the
   article is about something different) is just terrifying.  Imagine
   losing the ability to recognise all of your loved ones, to know who
   you are or where you are, and this not to be something that happens
   towards the end of your life, but at a time when you might
   conceivably have to live like that for 40 or 50 years.  Now imagine
   that it's not you that has this problem, but your partner...

10. [Implementing a JIT Compiled Language with Haskell and LLVM][no10]:
    On a *completely* different topic, this is a Haskell rendering of
    a long LLVM tutorial that looks really useful.  I've only read
    part of it so far, but it's good.
