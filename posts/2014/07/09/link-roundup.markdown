Here's a mixed bag of interesting links, some sciencey, some mathsy,
some miscellany:

1. [Network Rail Virtual Archives][no1]: OK, this might not, at first
   sight, sound like something interesting, but it really is.  This
   site has original Victorian-era engineering drawings for a whole
   range of British railway infrastructure.  Bridges, viaducts,
   stations, tunnels.  All rendered in lovely 19th Century
   penmanship.  The Forth Bridge is particularly nice.

2. [open.NASA][no2a]: A couple of years ago, NASA started a project to
   open-source code and data from their Earth observing and planetary
   missions.  Open.NASA is gateway to these resources.  I've not had a
   chance to look at it in huge detail yet, but there is a *lot* of
   stuff there.  The list of projects on the [code.NASA][no2b] part
   looks particularly entertaining.

3. [Game of Primes][no3]: Giganotosaurus is a science fiction site
   that publishes one (longish) short story each month.  They're often
   very good, and this one was particularly striking -- it's quite
   beautifully done, full of mystery, and feels like it could be a
   part of something much larger and deeper.

4. [Surprising connections in mathematics][no4]: This one is a bit
   more technical, from the Math Overflow Q&A website.  A lot of the
   connections people mention are *very* technical, but some are more
   accessible, for instance the link between algebra and geometry
   developed by Descartes and others in the 17th Century.  This is
   something we learn about in school, and something that we don't
   think about too much because it seems "obvious".  Only obvious in
   retrospect, of course, since it took hundreds of years for the
   connection to be discovered!

5. [De Bruijn grids and tilings][no5]: Another technical one, but very
   interesting.  Aperiodic tilings of the plane, like Penrose tilings,
   are slightly mysterious.  This article gives a really clear
   description of one systematic method for generating such tilings.
   It's a very odd and intriguing little bit of mathematics.

6. [Atul Gawande on end-of-life care][no6]: Atul Gawande is one of my
   favourite writers on medical and ethical issues.  This article is
   quite long, but well worth a read.
