I've just finished my first week in a new job, which is looking like
it's going to be a lot of fun.  I'm working for
[MemCachier](http://www.memcachier.com), a small company (I'm employee
#4) that offers a multi-tenant cloud-based `memcache` service.  The
code is mostly Haskell and Go (and maybe in the future some Rust), the
people are all very smart and friendly and committed to trying to do
things the right way.  I'm still (obviously, after one week) in that
initial state of confusion when dropping into a new codebase, but it
looks very promising indeed.

The work should be a good mix of web programming, DevOps automation
things and distributed systems problems.  There's going to be lots to
learn, which is ideal for me!  I'm also very happy to be back working
in Haskell after a year-long (or a bit more) diversion into Python.

So, as far as I'm concerned, 2017 has started off very well.
