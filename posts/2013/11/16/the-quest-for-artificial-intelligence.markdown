*by Nils Nilsson*

Nils Nilsson has been involved in artificial intelligence research
more or less since the inception of the field in the late 1950s.  (He's
probably best known for his work on
[Shakey the robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakey_the_Robot),
[A* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), and
his idea of
[teleo-reactive planning](http://ai.stanford.edu/users/nilsson/trweb/tr.html).)
This makes him ideally placed to write a history of artificial
intelligence.

This book is a fairly straightforward history, picking out highlights
from each of the distinct phases that AI research has gone through in
the last 60 years, with a digression in the middle to talk about some
more philosophical issues.  The book is as comprehensive as is
realistically possible in a work of this size, although it becomes a
little more fragmentary as we move towards the present -- as Nilsson
himself says, historians have to cede to more immediate and current
sources of information for current affairs, so he just shows a few
examples of what's been going on in the last few years.

A few things struck me quite strongly:

First, there really is nothing new under the sun.  So many of the
ideas that are important today in AI research were discovered or
invented in the very early days of the field, but languished due to
inadequate computing resources or other technological limitations or
because of lack of funding.  Much of modern AI research seems to be a
rediscovery or reworking of these ideas in a setting where they can be
exploited as their inventors had initially hoped.

Second, I was shocked (although in retrospect that was a product of my
own na√Øvety) by how much AI research has been funded by the military.
For most of the 1970s, it seems as though almost the entirety of the
US AI research community was funded by DARPA or other DOD elements.
It makes sense, but it seems something of a shame that what started as
an intellectual quest for the foundations of human consciousness
should be largely applied to warfare.

Third, much of the book dedicated to more recent periods is taken up
with descriptions of things I would hesitate to call artificial
intelligence.  Very few people are working towards the goal of
creating human level general artificial intelligence any more.
There's much more interest in applications based on machine learning
and data mining -- the huge volumes of data now available for training
these systems makes machine translation and other natural language
processing tasks, as well as machine vision, planning and other
complex activities, amenable to analysis by relatively unsophisticated
algorithms, algorithms that certainly don't provide any insight into
what "general intelligence" is.

For me, perhaps the most interesting part of the book is the
philosophical digression about what AI is, and Nilsson's comments on
human level AI.  The book is worth picking up for that alone.
Although Nilsson is careful not to make any overly judgmental remarks,
you can read between the lines to get a sense of what he really
thinks.

One slightly odd thing: no mention of Douglas Hofstadter.  I would
have been interested to see Nilsson try to put Hofstadter's work on
analogies and knowledge representation into the context of more
conventional work in that area.
