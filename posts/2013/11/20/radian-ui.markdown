I've been doing some work on interactive features for the
[Radian plotting library](http://openbrainsrc.github.io/Radian/)
recently, mostly just floating UI elements to allow you to switch
between linear and log axes, to change the number of bins in
histograms, and so on.  There's an
[article on the BayesHive blog](https://bayeshive.com/blog/12/interactive-plots-with-the-radian-ui)
showing some examples of how this works.

Now I just have to write some documentation to go with the spiffy new
features...
