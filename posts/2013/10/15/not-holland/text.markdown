We've started running recently, with the slightly ridiculous goal of
doing a marathon up a mountain in almost exactly a year's time.
(Idiots.)

All the stuff you read about running for beginners says "Stay away
from the hills!  Do nice easy runs on the flat!".  They talk about
keeping to a conversational pace, or running so that you take one
in-and-out breath for eight steps, or something like that.  Holland
would be perfect for beginner runners -- nothing very steep, and
certainly no long hills to wear your legs out.

Ah well.  We don't live in Holland.  It's lovely living in the
mountains, but it does mean that flat running routes are pretty thin
on the ground.  Our "flattest" route, which takes me about half an
hour, includes the cheeky little bit of path shown in the photo.  To
be fair, that *is* the absolute steepest part of the route, but it
takes a little while to recover from it -- I spend the next five
minutes wheezing like someone with a life-long 40-a-day smoking habit.
For "conversational", I might manage "Urgh"...

The other routes we do at the moment have either continuous up and
down through the woods, with roots and mud and no chance to get into
any sort of rhythm, or a longer route across the fields which involves
a longish climb, followed by a longish climb, followed, if you do the
"extended" version, by a longish *steep* climb.  One other "target"
route that we use quite often for walking Winnie has some bits that
are probably just too steep and rocky to run.  And then there's the 10
km run up "the" mountain behind our house, probably followed by beer
and schapps at the top and a ride down in the cable car.  But even
with beer and schnapps to aim for, it's still 10 km with 1500 m of
climbing.  I don't think we're ready for that yet!

Anyway, even if the ups and downs are a bit hard on the body (I had to
take a week off after slightly overdoing things recently), it
definitely makes your legs strong.  Running around here is also nice
in that you're pretty much guaranteed to see someone else out running
too, so you know that you're not the only one suffering!
