On our trip to Kärnten the other week, we drove up past the
Großglockner, the highest mountain in Austria.  We didn't actually see
the thing, since it was wreathed in clouds, but there was some other
cool stuff to see.  There were marmots!

Now, we've seen marmots before.  They're pretty common in the
mountains here, way up above the treeline.  They live in among the
rock piles up there and eat the little alpine plants.  And Winnie
loves them.  And hates them.

The problem is that marmots are just too clever for a little dog like
Winnie.  They live in among the rocks, where it's hard to run and
chase them.  And they always have a sentry marmot.  This little guy
(or girl) stands upright by their hole and keeps an eye out for danger
while the other marmots forage further from their holes.  For marmots,
danger usually comes in the shape of Death From Above, meaning big
hungry birds.  That means that the sentry is pretty alert.  As soon as
the sentry spots something dangerous, he or she squeaks a warning call
and all the other marmots run back to their holes.  Because the sentry
stays right by its hole, it can escape from danger even after it's
warned all its marmot friends.  Clever...

And the sentry recognises crazy marmot-chasing dogs as "danger".
Which means that there's an *infuriating*, **exciting** squeaking
going on *all the time* when you're in marmot country, and the silly
humans won't let you loose to chase it!  (The humans aren't so silly:
I don't really fancy carrying 20 kg of dog down the mountain if she
breaks her legs in the rocks.  Plus, she would stress the marmots,
which we don't want.)

But what if there was another way?  What if someone had built **marmot
viewing platforms** along the side of the road right above a place
where there are dozens of them?  How exciting would that be?  Huh?
HUH?  Answer: really quite exciting, actually.  Really very exciting
indeed.  Exciting enough that certain little dogs might find
themselves fixated and trembling from their noses to the tips of their
tails, not moving a muscle (apart from the trembling) for ten minutes
at a time.  There are **marmots**!  And they aren't running away!  And
I'm allowed to stare at them as much as I want!  I **like** this
holiday!

Winnie's behaviour around other animals is interesting to watch.  She
does get *insanely* excited and wants wants WANTS to chase things.
But when she gets close enough to other animals to interact with them,
she backs off, looking a little bit embarrassed, as if to say "I
wasn't really chasing you.  Oh no.  Just heading for this
oh-so-interesting sniff just here.  That's what I was running for.
Er.  Hello?  Would you be my friend?".  We often ask ourselves what
she would do if she got close to a deer or a marmot or something else.
She's cautious around horses and cows (too big to play with!), scared
of sheep (she got zapped by an electric fence once next to a sheep
field), indifferent to goats (non-scarey sheep?), but deer, cats,
marmots, birds, squirrels, mice and any other little thing she finds
is super exciting.

We do have a couple of data points that would indicate that she
wouldn't be aggressive to the animals she chases (although chasing
without any aggression is stressful enough for some animals -- they
don't know that she's friendly).  We've had cats visit us from time to
time, and while she gets very excited, Winnie keeps a little bit of
distance.  Once the cat gets up to move somewhere else, Winnie will
pounce on the place where the cat was sitting to do some mad sniffing,
but she doesn't do anything *to* the cat.  She also discovered a
hedgehog in our garden once and just sniffed it and came to find us,
rather than rolling it into a ball and using it as a plaything.  I'd
like to think she'd behave in a similar way to other animals of a
comparable size.  Smaller things, mice and little birds, I don't know
about.  They're too close in size to toys to be really safe...
