I remember being pretty blown away by the constraint-based drawing
tools in AutoCAD the first time I used them, and I've been try for a
long time to make some space to work on this sort of thing for myself
(I got started [a while ago](/blog/tags/constraints.html), but stalled
through lack of time).

Of course, there really is nothing new under the sun.
Constraint-based drawing started in the 1960s, using hardware built in
the **1950s** (built using individual transistors: no integrated
circuits back then!).
[Ivan Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland)'s
Sketchpad was where it all started.  I was reminded of this by a short
[article about Sutherland][interview] I only got around to reading
this morning.  The article is only so-so, but there are links to some
[videos][videos] taken from a TV programme made in the 1960s about the
MIT Lincoln lab where Sutherland worked.  They knew how to make
science TV in those days.  The steady hum of the air conditioning in
the machine room, the formal "Well, here's how it works, John"
presentation, the suits and ties.  Ah, I can almost smell the Bakelite
and ozone.  It's great.  Go and watch them and wallow in the
techno-nostalgia.

So, this TV programme was recorded in 1963.  And they had: GUI display
with light pen interaction; 2-D constraint-based drawing; zooming user
interfaces; 3-D graphics with hidden line removal; 3-D
constraint-based drawing; object linking and embedding.  1963!  How
the hell did they do all that?  Most of those ideas didn't make it
into commercial software until the 1990s, and a lot of people still
don't really know about the constraint-based stuff.

There's a great quote on the Wikipedia page about Sutherland:

> When asked, "How could you possibly have done the first interactive
> graphics program, the first non-procedural programming language, the
> first object oriented software system, all in one year?" Ivan
> replied: "Well, I didn't know it was hard."

That's the attitude you need: forge ahead in ignorance of what
received wisdom says is possible.  That's a credo I could like by.  If
it doesn't contradict the laws of physics, it's not impossible, so get
on and try it!
