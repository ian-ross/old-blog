When we lived in Canada, we spent a lot of time biking.  Road biking,
mountain biking, a bit of touring, we were always on our bikes (when
we weren't in kayaks...).

A [recent video][video] on [PinkBike](http://www.pinkbike.com) brought
it all back to us.  We sat there (me with a little tear in my eye, I
have to say) watching a couple of guys MTB touring around British
Columbia, ending up on Vancouver Island, where they visited a bunch of
places we used to go to all the time (the [Riding Fool][fool] in
Cumberland!), took ferries all over the place (it's the BC way) and
rode in the rain, in the sun and everything in between.

It looked amazing, and brought back so many memories.  I do still miss
Canada.
