When I started doing yoga, it looked simple.  Twist yourself into a
little pretzel, sit there for a little while, then choose a different
pretzel shape and repeat.  It turns out that things aren't quite so
simple.  You have to engage *muscles* to remain in these twisty
positions and even to pull yourself further into the postures.

Knowing which muscles to engage and where to focus your attention in
each posture is something that a good teacher would help with, of
course, but I'm a bit teacherless.  There is some advice available
online, much of it expressed in terms of analogies ("embrace your
thigh", and so on).  That's OK, but it's not a substitute for a
precise anatomical description of what's going on.

Raymond Long's two series of books, "Scientific Keys" and "The Mat
Companion", both available from his [Bandha Yoga site][bysite], are an
amazing and unique resource to help with this.  There are two
"Scientific Keys" books and four "Mat Companion" books, all of which
are full of high quality anatomical illustrations and detailed
descriptions of how to make a whole range of yoga postures work.  Some
of the descriptions are at the level of "engage the lower third of the
trapezius here", but there are also a lot of very simple and clear
cues for engaging and getting to know about muscles that you might not
otherwise think about.

There are four or five cues for each posture, plus a lot of general
advice about flexibility and joint health.  I've not seen anything
else anything like Long's books out there, and I'd really recommend
them to anyone who's either studying yoga on their own, or who just
wants to improve their practise.
