title: Mediterranean Climate Blues...

To compensate for the psychopathic driving habits of the French, the
Mediterranean climate is often offered up as a benefit of life here.
For those of us who are not all that keen on temperatures in the 30s
for weeks on end in the summer, that's not much of a compensation.
However, today, I would offer another piece of evidence that this
"Mediterranean climate" isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Here's the
swimming pool in our residence, with a nice layer of ice all across
it.  And yes, Rita is wearing a down jacket, an article of clothing
more common on the ski slopes and high mountains than the
Mediterranean coast...
