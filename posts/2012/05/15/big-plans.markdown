So, over the weekend Rita and myself made a big step.  We both sent in
resignation letters for our jobs in France!  Neither of us likes
living in Montpellier and, although Rita's job is more interesting for
her than mine is for me, she wants to have a change of career and is
trying to get a place to study occupational therapy in Innsbruck.

For me, my current post-doc hasn't really worked out the way I wanted
it to, and I don't want to apply for a permanent job with CNRS in
France, so I'm going to branch out a bit and try to get some freelance
contracting work, either programming or writing (or more likely, a bit
of both), spend some time working on open-source and personal
projects, and learn to make beer and wine and schnapps!

We're going to spend the summer at Rita's parents' place in
Ravelsbach, so as to have a bit of time to configure our brains for a
complete change of scene.  We have lots of things to do over the
summer, and we both have that feeling you get when you've made a big
decision, that you just want, in some sense, to move on to the next
thing.  We'll have three weeks more of work in France when we get back
from holiday to clear everything up and get all our projects into a
state where they can be continued by other people, then we'll be
packing up and moving here to Austria.

We're both kind of excited by the whole thing.  Even if it does mean
that I really *really* have to learn German properly this time!
