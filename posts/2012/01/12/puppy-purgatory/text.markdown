Yesterday evening, we had a meeting with
[Martine](http://martine-cruz.franceserv.com/), the dog behaviourist
who's helping us with Winnie.  Winnie has come a long way from the
terribly frightened little dog that we picked up from the animal
shelter four months ago.  She's no longer terrified of everything in
sight, she runs around with her tail up, likes to play with other
dogs, likes to sniff in the bushes, likes to run crazily through the
fallen leaves in the forest.  She's still jumpy and easily gets scared
of people in the street or sudden noises, but she's come a long way.

Unfortunately, we might have taken the gently-gently treatment we were
pursuing to help her stop being so fearful a little bit too far.  She
doesn't come when called, unless it suits her, and we had been
escalating the treats we offered her to a slightly ridiculous degree.
Time for a slightly stricter regime, to let her understand her
position in the household.  In the long run, it will be better for all
of us: no more frustrating walks in the park where she won't come
back, no more worries as she wanders off for 15 or 20 minutes at a
time, well out of sight, and safer walks near the road.  She has no
idea at all that cars and roads and human things in general can be
dangerous, and will try to bolt into the road if she sees something
really scarey, a bin bag, for instance...

So, we went to a nearby park with a dog area and let her run around
with Jedi, Martine's "regulator" dog-in-training, who is a beautiful
Staffie cross.  Martine's diagnosis?  Laughing, "She doesn't give a
toss, does she?  She just doesn't care!  She's a confident little
dog.  She thinks she's the boss!"  We tried walking around the park
and hiding behind trees to see if Winnie would notice the absence of
her human protectors and come looking for us.  Eventually,
eventually...  Once she had exhausted the sniffing possibilities and
was wondering why it was so quiet, she came looking.  But not enough.

The prescription is Puppy Purgatory for 10 days or so.  No talking to
her, no cuddles, no games.  Commands, OK.  Praise if she comes when
called, OK.  Day-to-day chat, incessant "Good girl!", belly rubs, tug
games, no.  Not for a week and a half.  It's hard.  Harder for us than
for her, I think.  She just doesn't quite know what's going on, but we
have to ignore her soulful eyes and wagging tail.

But hard as it may be, it seems to be paying off a little already.
We've only had one day of this regime, and Winnie is already showing
more interest in us, at home at least.  I did a little bit of clicker
training with her in the flat after dinner, and she was doing
sit-stay-come pretty nicely: quite a bit better than usual.  We're
going to go for a walk in the garrigue near Martine's house next
weekend, and we'll see how much better Winnie is in terms of recall
and staying near us then.

In the meantime though, Puppy Purgatory for all three of us...
