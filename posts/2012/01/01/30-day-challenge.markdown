title: Thirty Day Challenges
---
Looking for a prod to jolt me out of an (involuntary) 45 day blogging
hiatus, I'm going to follow a scheme that Rita is using quite
successfully: the Thirty Day Challenge.  The idea is simple.  Just do
that thing, whatever it is, every day for thirty days.  The timescale
is short enough not to be daunting, but long enough to be
habit-forming.  Or that's the theory anyway.

I have a few things lined up, including a slew of book reviews of my
holiday reading and the creakingly slow commencement of my constraints
project, but we'll see how it goes.

OK, one down, 29 to go.  That wasn't so hard after all!
