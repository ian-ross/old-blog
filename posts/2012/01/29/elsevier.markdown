After referring to a paper in
[*Agricultural and Forest Meteorology*][afm] in the last post, I
remembered [something I read on Crooked Timber][ctarticle] the other
day.  Many people have a pretty good idea of how toxic the world of
academic publishing is -- if you don't, take a look at
[this recent Guardian piece][guaart] by Mike Taylor, who lays out the
issues pretty clearly.

But what can individual researchers do to fight the power and toxic
influence of the big publishers?  Personally, I only submit papers to
journals with an open-access policy (the EGU journals like
[Biogeosciences](http://www.biogeosciences.net/) are good here,
especially with their "open peer review" process), and try to
encourage co-authors to do the same.  But I am among the tiniest of
tiny fish in a very big pond, so what I do has an influence barely
measurable in pico-Seldons[^1].  Now some of the big fish are taking
an interest, and have started a
[movement](http://thecostofknowledge.com/)!  You should sign up if
you're involved in publishing scientific results and care at all about
the free dissemination of knowledge.

[^1]: A Seldon being the commonly accepted unit of historical
      influence.  Difficult to quantify precisely, but whatever the
      scale, I don't have many of them...
