Today, we had an early morning outing to the
[Plage de l'Espiguette](http://g.co/maps/tjmrd), a *big* beach about
30 km east of Montpellier.  We got up at 6:15, picked up the Modulauto
car at 7:00, persuaded Winnie into the back (she's still a bit scared
of cars...) and off we went.  We arrived at the car park before
sunrise and were the only people there!  Miles and miles of dunes were
ours alone!  Much frolicking there was.  And climbing up and down the
dunes.  And digging.  And chasing of sticks.  And rolling around
pretending to be a dog (just Ian, since Winnie is a dog, and Rita
isn't quite as silly as me).  It was a lovely morning, and the dunes
were very pretty indeed.  We'll be going back there again, some time
before the summertime beach dog ban comes in.  And hopefully, with
more doggie company next time, since I think Winnie could have done
with a four-legged buddy to run around with.  I do my best, but I
don't quite have what it takes for *serious* boisterous play, since I
can't run at 40 km/h for hours and hours at a time...
