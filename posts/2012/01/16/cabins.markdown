I've been thinking for a long time, mostly privately in my idle
moments, about the sort of house I'd one day like to build for
myself.  I have some ideas that I think are pretty cool: multiple
small wooden buildings, connected by walkways, with the main building
on a slope with a stepped living area; a separate Japanese-style
bathhouse; an octagonal library/study with windows all around; a
cellar dug into the side of the hill.

Of course, all of this is nothing more than idle daydreaming.
Recently though, Rita sent me a link to some pictures of cabins
(sheds, huts, that sort of thing) that capture a lot of the spirit of
what I've been thinking of.  You can see them [here][link] (yes, the
link is safe!).  Some of these places look heavenly.
