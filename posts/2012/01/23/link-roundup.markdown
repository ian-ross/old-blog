Some interesting things that passed through my RSS reader recently:

[Food pairing and flavour networks](http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/27372/)
<br>
This is kind of interesting.  Why do cheese and bacon (if you eat that
kind of thing) go together so well?  Or asparagus and butter?  Or
caviar and chocolate?  (Apparently.  If you're Heston Blumenthal.)
The hypothesis was that these "paired" foods had many flavour
compounds in common.  The data presented in this preprint seems to
confirm that idea for Western cookery, but contradict it for Asian
cuisine.  There's a lot more in there about the evolution of recipes,
clusters of ingredients, and other network analysis goodness.

[Economists doing something right?](http://crookedtimber.org/2012/01/14/towards-a-21-hour-working-week/)
<br>
The people at [Crooked Timber](http://crookedtimber.org) always have a
lot of interesting things to say.  This is a summary and some
discussion of a meeting at the
[New Economics Foundation](http://www.neweconomics.org/) talking about
the need to cut consumption and spread wealth around by redistributing
working hours.  From a personal point of view, the idea of earning a
reasonable salary from a 21-hour working week and having time to work
on personal projects, do some volunteering, spend time with Rita and
Winnie, all sounds great.  From a social point of view, a gradual
redistribution of working hours to reduce unemployment and spread
income around more fairly also sounds fine.  It seems unlikely to
happen, if only because NEF seems to be the only group of economists
who can bear to think about the end of economic growth and a
transition to a steady-state economy.  When I listen to mainstream
economists speak, I have this image in my mind of a train racing along
a bridge which is being frantically cobbled together bit by bit as the
train approaches.  Sometimes the train gets closer to the edge,
sometimes it backs off a little way.  But in the long run, the bridge
builders can't win.  They're just going to run out of stuff to build
more bridge.

[Some good news](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/health/india-full-year-without-a-reported-case-of-polio-is-a-first-in-what-was-a-longtime-hot-spot.html?_r=1&ref=health)
<br>
To leaven the economics misery, this is really good.  Polio is on the
way out in India: not one new case in the last year!
