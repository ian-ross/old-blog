---
I'm a sucker for nature photos.  One of our annual outings when we
lived in Bristol was to the Nature Photographer Of The Year exhibition
at the city museum.  Going by the crowds there, we aren't the only
ones who like this stuff.

So, here's some eye candy.

First, The Boston Globe has
[The 50 Best Photos From The Natural World](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/12/50_best_photos_of_the_natural.html).
I don't know about the 50 *best*, but they're pretty good!

Like old stuff?
[Here's](http://iheartphotograph.blogspot.com/2011/10/oldest-living-things-in-world.html)
some old stuff.  Some of the oldest there is.  Photos of some of the
oldest living things in the world.  And if you like thought-provoking
images of old organisms, check out [Mike Iverson's rendition of
"Bristlecone Pine"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ-qe19gY34), an
image in sound.

And lastly, let's look at some eyes.  And what eyes.  Suren Manvelyan
took a simple idea (photograph ideas) and produced
[something truly beautiful](http://www.surenmanvelyan.com/).  Be sure
to check out both the images of animal eyes and those of humans.  The
variation in patterns is fascinating.
