title: Winter is here!

We woke up to snow in the garden, snow all around this morning.  There
had been some rather slushy sleety attempts at snow yesterday evening,
but nothing that would have made us believe that we would wake up to
the first white blanketing of the year in the morning.

It was pretty grey when I set out from the house with Winnie for our
morning walk.  After some crazy sniffing for mice in the fields below
our house, we climbed up into the forest near Lanser Kopf, and the sun
came out through the clouds.  It was quite beautiful and very
mysterious, mist rising from the ground, wisps of cloud around the
mountains, beams of bright sunlight shining through the trees.

The sun came and went during the two hours of our walk, and we both
got pretty wet from snow falling from the trees as it melted.  Winnie
also got dirty enough to need a rinse in the bathtub when we got back
too!

Most of the snow has gone again this evening, at least down here in
Igls, although the mountains all around are still coated.  I guess
we'll be seeing a lot more of the white stuff soon!
