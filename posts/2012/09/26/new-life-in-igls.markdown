title: New Life In Igls
---
So, we've embarked on a new life here in Igls.  Rita has started
school, and I have done most of the paperwork to set myself up as an
independent software contractor.  It's all rather exciting!

There will be some changes here over the next couple of weeks, since I
want to use www.skybluetrades.net as my "professional" website.  I'm
also going to start blogging again, after a break over the summer.
